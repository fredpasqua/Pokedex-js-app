# Pokedex-js-app
This project was part of the CareerFoundy Javacript section in the full stack
developer course.

The project was to create a PokeDex which loads data from an external source(API)
and returns the data to the user.


The App displays a list of items loaded from the Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/)
The user can view more details by clicking on the name of a Pokemon in the list.
The App had to have CSS styling
The JavaScript code was formatted according to ESLint rules and was checked against
the linter in Atom, which I did manually.
The app also uses a modal, which was created utilizing the Bootstrap Library.
Other Bootstrap libray elements were used in the creation of the app including the
Navbar.
The App also allows the user to search via text input the list to filter the list.
The App works in all major browsers and is responsive.
I also used some jQuery in the script page as well as AJAX to fetch the data.
Color scheme from the original Pokemon Series was used and logos were created
in Poke style.
